### **Scrum Meetings**

- **Daily **- in 1 minute say:
  - **what have I** done recently?
  - **what will I** work on today?
  - **what is preventing **me from working?
- **Review** - how do I present the achievements of the last sprint? \
  Focus on results/”done” stories, and the created customer value. \
  Talk about the solutions you delivered, not problems you encountered!
- **Planning** - estimate what we can achieve in the next sprint? \
  What is realistic, what not?
- **Retro **- adapt for the next sprint
  - moderate one retro in v-team \
    Consider the different phases to activate the participants, collect insights and define action steps
  - participate in retros: \
    Talk about things that reduced your productivity or satisfaction, talk about what bothers you, and what should be different in the future. \
    Goal: **Define action steps **for all or some team members for the next sprint. \
    NOT the goal: Vent (or rant) about a topic.

### **Work ethics**

- **Think in solutions, not problems**
  - When faced with a difficult situation (technical, structural, personal,...) think about what you can do. \
    Collect possible solutions, discuss them, choose one and implement it.
  - If someone drifts into complaining about things that do not go well, remind that person that things won't change if you just complain about it (Note that this is a "problem thinking" sentence! Complaining about someone who is complaining does not solve anything!)
  - Instead: \
    If someone drifts into complaining about things that do not go well, remind that person that things will (only) change, if you adapt and approach the current task/situation differently. (This is "solution thinking". It might help the complaining person to step into solution-mode)
- **Always be polite and honest \
  **But also don't be too polite (and let everything be done to you).
  - If something is going wrong or someone is acting in a bad or destructive way, communicate your perception. Do not close your eyes to something and suffer in silence.
  - Consider using the retro to talk about "bigger topics", and keep in mind to not take everything personal or too serious.
- **Transparency \
  **Your PO or other team members will highly appreciate if you tell them a task will take unexpectedly longer - instead of hiding it until a lot of time has passed.
- **Activity**
  - Don't just sit and listen in meetings. Be part of the active discussion.
  - OR: Ask politely if you may leave/skip the meeting if you think your time could be used more wisely. Usually, no one will force you to attend a meeting if your attentance has no benefit for the customer.
