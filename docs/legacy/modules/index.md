# Modules

## What is a Module?

A module is an action-based task with the goal to learn topics of the Apprentice Checklist. If you previously have worked with Scrum, you can compare a module to a story.

**It consists of**

- a precise description of requirements.

- a list of acceptance criteria.

- a list of prerequisites (optional)

**What it's not**:

- A list of articles you should read.

- Something like: “Learn Mockito”

_(Both examples have its place…which is the Apprentice Checklist)_
