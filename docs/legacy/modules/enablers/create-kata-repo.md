# Create Kata Repository

## Description

During your Apprentice Programm you will solve multiple katas. Solving them will improve your skill. You gain even more if an experienced college reviews your code.

Therefore, create a new repository with your own KB GitHub Account. Invite your Introducer and Mentor (if you have one, yet) as collaborator.

## Acceptance Criteria

- #AC1: Repository exists.
- #AC2: Your Introducer has collaboration rights.
