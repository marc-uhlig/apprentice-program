# Roadmap

## Goal

The main goal of our Apprentice program is to become project-ready. This means the Apprentice has a fundamental
understanding of Full-Stack-Development.

## Timeline

The time to complete the Apprentice Project is roughly set to 12 weeks full-time plus the time for the project
internship.

## Content

The Mentor should adapt the content and structure of the Apprentice Programm to the Apprentice. Nonetheless it makes
sense to follow the basic structure described here.
